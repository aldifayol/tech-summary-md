# 🧠 Introducing the Neurosity MCP Server: AI Meets Neurodata

The article announces the launch of the **Neurosity MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**, enabling users to connect their Neurosity account and brain data from the **Crown** neurotechnology device to **AI providers** like Claude or ChatGPT.

---

## Key Features and Capabilities

* **AI Integration:** The MCP allows users to ask their favorite large language models (LLMs) questions that incorporate **live and historical brain data** captured by the Neurosity Crown.
* **Contextual Responses:** The LLMs can access metrics like your **live focus score**, brainwave distribution (alpha/beta/gamma), and calm scores to provide personalized recommendations and insights.

## Examples of LLM Queries

The article provides examples of the types of requests users can make to an LLM via the MCP:

* **Music Recommendation:** "What type of music can boost my current focus score?"
    > *The LLM can request permission to read your live focus score and recommend music frequencies (e.g., binaural beats at 15-30 Hz for beta waves) to increase productivity.*

* **Data Visualization:** "Record my brainwaves and use JavaScript to create a pie chart of my current alpha/beta/gamma distribution."
    > *The LLM can both request brainwave recording permission and write code for data visualizations.*

* **Lifestyle Recommendations:** "Compare my focus and calm scores and recommend some lifestyle changes."
    > *The LLM can analyze trends (e.g., increased focus but decreased calm) and suggest immediate actions to manage stress or agitation.*

## Implementation and Access

* **Powered by the Neurosity SDK:** The MCP server leverages the Neurosity SDK, providing access to all the data the Crown offers.
* **Availability:** The Neurosity MCP server is available **today for free** to all Crown users.
* **Setup:** Users can easily set up the connection by adding a custom connector within their AI provider's interface, using the following details:
